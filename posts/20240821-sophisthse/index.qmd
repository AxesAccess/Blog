The article introduces a Python library called `sophisthse` that
provides access to Russian macroeconomic statistics time series
published by the National Research University Higher School of Economics
(HSE). The library aims to simplify the process of working with Russian
macroeconomic data and facilitate the analysis of economic trends in the
country. The article demonstrates how to use the library to list
available time series, download data, and visualize the time series
data.

## Acknowledgments

The library is a port of the `sophisthse` R package developed by [Boris
Demeshev](https://github.com/bdemeshev). The original package provides
similar functionality for working with Russian macroeconomic data in R.
The Python version of the library is designed to offer the same features
to Python users interested in analyzing Russian economic indicators.

## Source Data

The [sophist.hse.ru](http://sophist.hse.ru/hse/nindex.shtml) website
contains wide range of Russian macroeconomic statistics time series,
including data on GDP, inflation, unemployment, industrial production,
retail sales, and more. The data is originally sourced from the Federal
State Statistics Service of the Russian Federation (Rosstat) and other
official sources.

## Features

The `sophisthse` library provides the following features:

-   Listing available tables with time series data
-   Downloading and caching time series data

## Installation

You can install the library using `pip`:

``` bash
pip install sophisthse
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the library to download and plot the
time series data.

### List Available Time Series

Time series are published on the
[sophist.hse.ru](http://sophist.hse.ru/hse/nindex.shtml) website.
Initializing `sophisthse` class will download the list of available
tables. You can list the available tables using the `list_tables`
method:

```{python unnamed-chunk-1}
from sophisthse import sophisthse

sph = sophisthse()
tables = sph.list_tables()
tables
```

The column named `date` contains timestamp of the latest update. The
dates in this column hint that some tables may be out of date. Let's
take a look at the date of the latest update of the tables.

```{python unnamed-chunk-2}
# | fig-align: center
tables["year"] = tables["date"].dt.year
tables.groupby("year").size().plot(kind="bar")
```

The `{python} sum(tables.year == 2024)` out of `{python} len(tables)`
are being updated through 2024. Let's take a look at the most recently
updated tables.

```{python unnamed-chunk-3}
tables["date"] = tables["date"].dt.date
(
    tables.groupby("date")
    .agg({"name": lambda x: ", ".join(x)})
    .reset_index()
    .sort_values("date", ascending=False)
    .head()
)
```

### Download and Plot Time Series

According to the
[sophist.hse.ru](http://sophist.hse.ru/hse/nindex.shtml) website table
`AGR_M_I` provides the index of real agricultural production in column
`AGR_M_DIRI`, and seasonally adjusted one in the `AGR_M_DIRI_SA`. Let's
download it and take a look at the data.

```{python unnamed-chunk-4}
agr_m_i = sph.get_table("AGR_M_I")
agr_m_i.tail()
```

::: callout-note
After calling `get_table`, the data is cached locally. The next time
`get_table` is called, the data will be loaded from the cache. However,
if the table is updated on the server, which is checked when the
`sophisthse` class is initialized, the new data will be loaded from the
website.
:::

The method returns a pandas DataFrame, so we can plot the data using the
`plot` method.

```{python unnamed-chunk-5}
# | fig-align: center
agr_m_i.plot()
```

### Additional Example

According to the
[sophist.hse.ru](http://sophist.hse.ru/hse/nindex.shtml) website table
`FINMAR_M` contains data on the financial market.

```{python unnamed-chunk-6}
finmar = sph.get_table("FINMAR_M")
finmar.tail()
```

The first columns are:

-   `RDEXRO_M` - Official exchange rate of the ruble against the US
    dollar.
-   `RDEXRM_M` - Exchange rate of the US dollar on the Moscow Exchange.
-   `RTS_M` - Average [RTS
    index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS_Index).

The last four columns show NaNs for the most recent periods. Let's take
a look at the missing values.

```{python unnamed-chunk-7}
# | fig-align: center

sns.heatmap(~finmar.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap="Blues")
```

The heatmap shows that the data in the `IB_M`, `GKO_M`, `DEP_M`, and
`CR_M` columns is not available for the recent years, while the
`RDEXRO_M`, `RDEXRM_M`, and `RTS_M` columns have complete data.

Let's plot the `RTS_M` column. Due to the economic fluctuations, the RTS
index has a lot of volatility. We will add the moving average to the
plot.

```{python unnamed-chunk-8}
# | fig-align: center

finmar["RTS_M"].plot(label="RTS index")
finmar["RTS_M"].rolling(12, center=True).mean().plot(label="12-months MA")
plt.legend()
```

## Furhter Investigation

Looking at the tables, one can assume that the suffixes `_M`, `_Q` and
`_Y` in the names mean that the data was sampled monthly, quarterly and
annually, respectively. Let's check this assumption.

```{python unnamed-chunk-9}
# | fig-align: center


def guess_period(name: str):
    if "_M" in name:
        return "month"
    if "_Q" in name:
        return "quarter"
    if "_Y" in name:
        return "year"
    return "unknown"


tables["period"] = tables["name"].apply(guess_period)

tables.groupby("period").size().plot(kind="bar")
```

The bar plot shows that the assumption is partially correct. There are
tables with unknown sampling frequency. This information can be drawn
from the actual series after downloading data. It's not necessary for
demonstrative purposes, so we will skip this step.

Let's calculate the correlation matrix for the monthly data.

```{python unnamed-chunk-10}
# | fig-align: center

from time import sleep
from random import randint
import pandas as pd


monthly_tables = tables.query("period == 'month' & year >= 2023")

df = pd.DataFrame(index=pd.period_range(start="2014-01-01", end="2025-01-01", freq="M"))
for table in monthly_tables["name"]:
    df_add = sph.get_table(table)
    # We don't want to overload the server
    # sleep(randint(1, 3))
    df = df.merge(df_add, left_index=True, right_index=True)

# We do not want to deal with NaNs, at least at this time :)
df = df.dropna(how="any", axis=1)

# Keep only columns with "_M" suffix to skip derived columns
columns = [col for col in df.columns if col.endswith("_M")]

corr = df[columns].corr()

sns.heatmap(
    corr,
    vmin=-1.0,
    vmax=1.0,
    xticklabels=corr.columns.values,  # type: ignore
    yticklabels=corr.columns.values,  # type: ignore
    cmap="coolwarm",
)
```

The last column (or row) is the `WAG_C_M`. This is a monthly series of
the average nominal wage. It correlates with many economics indicators,
and it worth noting that `CBEX_M` (Consolidated Budget Expenditures)
explains almost 84% of `WAG_C_M` variability. Let's take a look at these
two series.

```{python unnamed-chunk-11}
# | fig-align: center

df_norm = df[columns].apply(lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std())
df_norm[["WAG_C_M", "CBEX_M"]].plot()
```

The plot shows that the `WAG_C_M` series follows the `CBEX_M` series
with great accuracy. This is an interesting observation that can be used
in further analysis.

## Conclusion

The `sophisthse` library provides a convenient way to access and work
with Russian macroeconomic time series data. The library simplifies the
process of downloading and caching data, making it easier to analyze
economic trends in Russia. The library is a valuable resource for
researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in studying the Russian
economy.
