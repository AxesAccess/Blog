## Introduction

This project showcases my process of building analytical dashboard for
business decision-making, specifically in the e-commerce domain. The
dashboard is built in Power BI and integrates R scripts for advanced
analytics. The dashboard was created as part of the November 2025
DataDNA Dataset Challenge and was selected as the winner in both overall
and accessibility categories.

## Key Features

The dashboard includes several analytical features. The implementation
of these involved data processing and modeling techniques, which I will
outline below.

### Revenue Forecast

For the executives it’s important to know ahead of time whether the
revenue will meet the target for the set period. To address this, I
implemented a time series forecasting model. The model takes into
account seasonality and trends to provide accurate revenue predictions.
Due to the limited data span of less than two years, I opted for a
simpler forecasting approach using `auto.arima` function from R's
`forecast` package.

The model was used to generate revenue forecasts for various segments,
including country, category, and channel. I integrated the forecasting
results into the Power BI dashboard, enabling users to easily view and
interact with forecasts alongside historical data, with smooth segment
switching when applying cross-filtering.

### ABC/XYZ Analysis

A classic way to segment products is by using ABC analysis. This method
classifies products based on their revenue, placing items that
contribute the most to revenue in category A, those with moderate
contribution in category B, and the rest in category C.

![Number of SKU by ABC/XYZ Segment visualized using Matrix visual from
standard Power BI library](abc-xyz-matrix.svg){#fig-abc-xyz-matrix}

To complement this, I applied XYZ analysis, which segments products
based on their sales variability. Products with stable demand are
classified as X, those with moderate variability as Y, and highly
variable products as Z. Combining ABC and XYZ analyses provides a
comprehensive view of product performance, enabling more informed
inventory and marketing strategies.

### RFM Segmentation

Another widely used customer segmentation technique is RFM analysis,
which focuses on three key metrics: Recency (how recently a customer
made a purchase), Frequency (how often they purchase), and Monetary
value (how much they spend). By scoring customers on these dimensions,
businesses can identify their most valuable customers and tailor
marketing efforts accordingly.

![RFM segments are three-dimensional, which is why it’s common practice
to combine Frequency and Monetary into a single FM axis (on the
left).](rfm.svg){#fig-rfm}

To make the segmentation more intuitive, I defined nine segments
(levels) based on RFM scores: "Champions", "Loyal Customers", "New
Customers", "Potential Loyalists", "Promising", "Needs Attention",
"Cannot Lose Them", "At Risk", "Hibernating". This categorization helps
in devising targeted strategies for customer retention and engagement.

## Details of Implementation

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The most data cleaning and transformation steps were performed using R
scripts running in Power Query, but first I explored the dataset in
RStudio. Here are the documents produced by Quarto during the data
analysis phase:

### Power BI Data Model

Tables and relations in the Power BI data model are organized following
a "star" schema, with fact tables at the center connected to dimension
tables. This structure optimizes query performance and simplifies data
analysis.

### Power BI Visuals

Power BI visualizations are built using visuals from the standard Power
BI library, except for a few bar charts created with the Deneb custom
visual, which allows for advanced charting using the Vega-Lite grammar.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is structured into five key sections.

### Summary Page

The dashboard immediately shows key metrics.

### Loyalty Section

This section presents customer loyalty metrics, including Repeat Buyers
Share, Life-time Value, and Purchase Frequency.

### Products Section

This section provides descriptive statistics about products. It includes
ABC/XYZ analysis, Total Revenue breakdown by Category and Vendor, and
Top Products.

### Pricing Section

Pricing section provides insights into product pricing strategies,
including Discount Penetration, Average Discount, and Revenue Lift from
Discounts, as well as time series of Average Discount and Discount
Penetration.

### Customers Section

This tab presents the RFM segmentation results, showing the distribution
of customers across different segments and their contribution to total
revenue.

## Areas to Improve

### Dynamic Time Periods

The latest data point in the dataset is `2025-10-21`. All visuals in the
dashboard reflect the data for the calendar year 2025, using time-series
forecasting for the remaining months. This makes the dashboard
unsuitable for use outside of the narrow period of October-December
2025. To make this dashboard a working instrument, I would need to
implement a slicer for selecting the time period and adjust all measures
accordingly. The year slicer would not be a good choice for this task,
I'd rather opt for a date slicer with "Relative date filtering" option
set to "in the last 12 months" plus 1..2 month forecast.

### Web and Marketing Data

The dataset lacks web-analytics data, which would enable more
comprehensive customer behavior analysis. Additionally, the absence of
marketing data (except for the acquisition channel) prevents the
evaluation of campaign effectiveness and customer acquisition
strategies. Incorporating these data sources would significantly enhance
the analytical capabilities of the dashboard.

### Causal Modeling

The synthetic nature of the dataset also limits the depth of analysis:
the data is too random to uncover meaningful patterns or trends. Access
to real-world data would allow for causal modeling and insights.

## Conclusion

I hope this overview of the dashboard construction process, from initial
data cleaning to final model integration, gives the reader a clear
picture of the analytical work involved.
