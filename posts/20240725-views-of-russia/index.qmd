The article showcases the utilization of the `rnaturalearth` package for
handling geographical data. This package provides valuable tools and
functions for working with spatial information, making it a powerful
resource for data analysts and researchers interested in geographic
analyses.

Today, I stumbled upon an article discussing the approval ratings of
Russia among people from various nations around the world. As I examined
the list, which was sorted from worst to best, a hypothesis formed in my
mind: **Could the distance between this particular country and others
correlate with its citizens’ approval of its international affairs?** To
explore this, I promptly collected data and calculated the geographical
distances between the boundaries of Russia and those of the countries in
the list. The null hypothesis posits that distance has no impact on
approval rates, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that distance
does indeed influence approval levels.

```{r}

theme_set(theme_minimal())

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

df <- read.csv("ViewsOfRussia2024.csv")

by <- join_by(admin == country)
world <- left_join(world, df, by)

world <- world[world$admin != "Antarctica", ]

ggplot(data = world) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = approval)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") + 
  # theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.key.height = unit(5, "pt"), 
        legend.key.width = unit(40, "pt"), 
        legend.title.position = "bottom") + 
  labs(fill = "% who have a favorable view of Russia")

```

```{r}

countries <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")
russia <- filter(countries, grepl("Russia", admin))

invisible(sf_use_s2(FALSE))

df <- df |> rowwise() |>
  mutate(distB = st_distance(russia, countries[countries$admin == country, ])[1])

df$distB <- as.numeric(sub("([0-9\\.]+)", "\\1", df$distB)) / 1000000

model <- lm(approval ~ distB, data = df)
summary(model)

```

The model explains less than 10% of variability. P-value for distance is
`r format(coef(summary(model))["distB","Pr(>|t|)"], digits=2)`, so the
null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the level of 0.05. Scatter plot
also shows no obvious trend.

```{r}

qplot(df$distB, df$approval) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "red", formula = y ~ x)

```

It emerged that the geographical distance between boundaries was
statistically insignificant. However, I propose an alternative
hypothesis in this scenario. Russia, being an exceptionally vast
country, shares proximity with Asian nations in its eastern part.
Interestingly, these eastern countries exhibit a more favorable attitude
toward Russia compared to their European counterparts. One plausible
explanation for this discrepancy is the absence of significant Russian
territorial interests in Asia. Since Moscow, the capital, lies in the
western part of Russia, **let’s measure the distance between capitals
and explore this further using regression analysis**.

```{r echo=TRUE}

cities <- ne_download(type = "populated_places", returnclass = "sf")
capitals <- cities[cities$FEATURECLA == "Admin-0 capital", ]

```

```{r}

capitals <- capitals |> distinct(ADM0NAME, .keep_all = TRUE)
moscow <- cities[cities$NAME == "Moscow", ]

df <- read.csv("ViewsOfRussia2024.csv")

by <- join_by(country == ADM0NAME)
df <- left_join(df, capitals, by) |> select(country, approval, NAME)

df <- df |> rowwise() |> 
  mutate(distC = st_distance(moscow, capitals[capitals$NAME == NAME, ])[1])
df$distC <- as.numeric(sub("([0-9\\.]+)", "\\1", df$distC)) / 1000000

model <- lm(approval ~ distC, data = df)
summary(model)

```

Unfortunately, using the distance between capitals didn’t yield
meaningful results either.

```{r}

qplot(df$distC, df$approval) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "red", formula = y ~ x)

```

In my search for additional regressors, I included GDP per capita,

```{r}
df <- read.csv("ViewsOfRussia2024.csv")

by <- join_by(country == admin)
df <- left_join(df, countries, by) |> select(country, approval, gdp_md, pop_est, economy)

df <- df |> mutate(gdp_pc = 1000 * gdp_md / pop_est)

model <- lm(approval ~ gdp_pc, data = df)
summary(model)

```

and it yielded promising results. The coefficient associated with GDP
showed a remarkably low p-value of 1.52e-08, providing strong evidence
against the null hypothesis. The coefficient of determination
(R-squared) was also quite favorable at 0.6377, indicating that the
model captures a substantial portion of the variation in approval rates.
The coefficient with `gdp_pc` indicates that for every additional
thousand USD of GDP per capita, there is a corresponding 0.7 percentage
point decrease in the approval rate.

```{r}

qplot(df$gdp_pc, df$approval) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) + 
  labs(x = "GDP per capita, K", y = "% who have a favorable view of Russia")

```

In an effort to enhance predictive power, one can explore the
possibility of non-linear dependencies. Let’s consider using the
logarithm of GDP as a predictor.

```{r}

model <- lm(approval ~ log(gdp_pc), data = df)
summary(model)

```

The resulting model yields an impressive R² value of 0.7073, indicating
that it explains the vast amount of the variation. Additionally, the
p-value of 4.77e-10 provides the strongest evidence against the null
hypothesis.

```{r}

qplot(log(df$gdp_pc), df$approval) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) + 
  labs(x = "Logarithm of GDP per capita", y = "% who have a favorable view of Russia")

```

However, this improved model is more complex and less straightforward to
explain. Allow me to attempt an interpretation: If a country’s GDP per
capita is 1% lower than another country’s, it tends to have 0.12% more
people who approve of Russia.

Now that we’ve obtained the regression model, we can use it to make
predictions for the remaining countries and visualize the results on a
map. By assigning colors based on predicted approval rates, we’ll create
an informative and visually appealing representation.

```{r}

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

world <- world[world$admin != "Antarctica", ]

world <- world |> mutate(gdp_pc = 1000 * gdp_md / pop_est)

invisible(na.omit(world, cols = "gdp_pc"))

pred <- predict(model, world)

world <- cbind(world, pred)

by <- join_by(admin == country)
world <- left_join(world, df, by)

world <- mutate(world, approval = coalesce(approval, pred))

world[world$admin == "Russia", ]$approval <- NA

ggplot(data = world) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = approval)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.key.height = unit(5, "pt"), 
        legend.key.width = unit(40, "pt"), 
        legend.title.position = "bottom") + 
  labs(fill = "")


```
