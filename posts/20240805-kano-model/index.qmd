The Kano model is a theory for product development and customer
satisfaction developed in the 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano. The model
classifies customer preferences into five categories: Must-be Quality,
One-dimensional Quality, Attractive Quality, Indifferent Quality, and
Reverse Quality. The Kano model is used to prioritize features and
functionalities in product development based on customer needs and
expectations.

## Categories of the Kano Model

**Must-be** features are basic requirements that customers expect. If
these features are not present in a product, customers will be
dissatisfied. However, the presence of these features does not
necessarily lead to customer satisfaction. Must-be Quality features are
considered essential for the product.

> Examples: a car must have wheels, a smartphone must have a battery, a
> website must have a search function.

**One-dimensional** features are directly proportional to customer
satisfaction. The more these features are present in a product, the more
satisfied customers will be. These features are usually explicitly
stated by customers and are easy to measure and quantify.

> Examples: a car with leather seats, a smartphone with a
> high-resolution camera, a website with fast loading times.

**Attractive** features are unexpected features that delight customers.
These features are not explicitly requested by customers but can create
a positive emotional response when present. Attractive Quality features
can differentiate a product from its competitors and create a
competitive advantage.

> Examples: a car with a built-in navigation system, a smartphone with
> facial recognition technology, a website with personalized
> recommendations.

**Indifferent** features are neither good nor bad from the customer's
perspective. Customers are indifferent to these features, and their
presence or absence does not significantly impact customer satisfaction.
These features are often considered "nice to have" but not essential.

> Examples: a car with cup holders, a smartphone with a stylus, a
> website with social media integration.

**Reverse** features are features that, when present, can lead to
customer dissatisfaction. These features may be perceived as unnecessary
or even annoying by customers. It is essential to identify and eliminate
Reverse Quality features to prevent negative customer experiences.

> Examples: a car with uncomfortable seats, a smartphone with a short
> battery life, a website with intrusive pop-up ads.

## Prioritizing Features with the Kano Model

Example of a Kano diagram.

With the Kano model, prioritization of features and functionalities
becomes clear and straightforward as that:

**a)** keep eye on the *Must-be Quality* features, as they are
essential, **b)** incorporate *One-dimensional Quality* features to
increase customer satisfaction, **c)** consider *Attractive Quality*
features to create a competitive advantage; **d)** eliminate *Reverse
Quality* features, and **e)** save resources by setting *Indifferent
Quality* features as low priority.

## Implementation of the Kano Analysis

Implementing the Kano model involves a sequence of steps, beginning with
the development of a questionnaire. For each feature, two types of
questions are posed: functional and dysfunctional.

-   The **functional question** assesses respondents' feelings when a
    feature is present.
-   The **dysfunctional question** gauges their reactions in the absence
    of that feature.

Each question offers five possible responses, from "I like it" to "I
dislike it." Subsequently, these responses are classified into the five
Kano categories.

```{python iterp}
# | echo: false
# | label: tbl-cap-margin
# | cap-location: top
# | tbl-cap: "Classification of answers to the Kano questionnaire."
# | tbl-cap-location: top
# |
import pandas as pd

interp = pd.read_csv("data/kano-interp.csv")

interp.groupby(["Functional", "Dysfunctional"]).agg({"Category": "first"}).unstack()
```

After the classification of responses, the next step is to calculate the
satisfaction and dissatisfaction scores for each feature. The
satisfaction influence score is calculated as the percentage of
Attractive and One-dimensional responses relative to the total number of
responses.

$$ \text{Satisfaction Influence} = \dfrac{A + O}{ A + O + M + I } \times 100 \% $$ {#eq-satisfaction-influence}
The dissatisfaction influence score is calculated as the percentage of
One-dimensional and Must-be responses relative to the total number of
responses.

$$ \text{Dissatisfaction Influence} =  - \dfrac{O + M}{A + O + M + I} \times 100 \% $$ {#eq-dissatisfaction-influence}

The features are then plotted on a Kano diagram, with the
dissatisfaction score on the x-axis and the satisfaction score on the
y-axis. The features are categorized based on their position in the
diagram: Attractive Quality features in the upper left quadrant,
One-dimensional Quality features in the upper right quadrant, Must-be
Quality features in the lower right quadrant, and Indifferent features
in the lower left quadrant, as depicted in the @fig-kano-example.

## Example implementation of the Kano Analysis

### Conducting a Kano Survey

For illustrative purposes, let's consider existing dataset with
responses to a Kano questionnaire from [Doing Research Online: The Kano
Model](https://github.com/REPPL/Doing-research-online-the-kano-model)
project by [Alex Reppel](https://github.com/REPPL) published on GitHub
under the GPL-3.0 License. The dataset consists of five csv files
containing responses to functional and dysfunctional questions for
various features, along with demographic information about the
respondents.

```{python load-data}
# | echo: false

import os
import pandas as pd


directory = "data"
files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith("-clean.csv")]

df = pd.DataFrame()

for file in files:
    df = pd.concat([df, pd.read_csv(f"{directory}/{file}")])

df = df.reset_index(drop=True)

dataframe_length = len(df)
dataframe_shape = df.shape
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's explore data. The dataframe of shape `{python} dataframe_shape`
includes an `ID` column, multiple columns with demographic data such as
`Income_us`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Employment`, and `Education`, as well as
responses to functional and dysfunctional questions (`F1_functional`,
`F1_dysfunctional`, etc), and columns indicating the importance of
certain features to the customer (`F1_importance`, `F2_importance`,
etc).

```{python fig-hist-age}
# | echo: false
# | warning: false
# | label: fig-hist-age
# | fig-cap: Histogram of respondents' age


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set_style("ticks")

axes = df.plot.hist(
    column=["Age"],
    by="Gender",
    bins=20,
    color="skyblue",
    edgecolor="black",
    sharex=True,
    sharey=True,
)

plt.xlabel("Age")

# hide legend
for ax in axes:
    ax.legend().set_visible(False)

plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()
plt.close()
```

The customers' age distribution is relatively balanced, with a slight
skew towards younger respondents.

```{python fig-income-hist}
# | echo: false
# | warning: false
# | label: fig-income-empl-hist
# | layout-ncol: 2
# | fig-cap:
# |   - "Income distribution"
# |   - "Employment distribution"

# Income distribution

df_income = df.groupby(["Income_us"]).size().reset_index(name="Count")

sort_income = [
    "prefer_not_to_answer",
    "less_than_15",
    "15000_to_24999",
    "25000_to_34999",
    "35000_to_49999",
    "50000_to_74999",
    "75000_to_99999",
    "100000_to_149999",
    "150000_to_249999",
    "250000_or_more",
]

df_income["Sort"] = df_income["Income_us"].apply(lambda x: sort_income.index(x))
df_income = df_income.sort_values("Sort").drop("Sort", axis=1)

df_income.plot.bar(
    x="Income_us",
    y="Count",
    color="skyblue",
    edgecolor="black",
    legend=False,
    figsize=(4, 4),
)

plt.xlabel("")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title("Income distribution")

plt.show()
plt.close()

# Employment distribution

df_employment = df.groupby(["Employment"]).size().reset_index(name="Count")

sort_employment = [
    "temporarily-unemployed",
    "student_part_time",
    "student_full_time",
    "employed_part_time",
    "employed_full_time",
    "self_employed",
    "other",
    "retired",
    "homemaker",
    "disability",
]

df_employment["Sort"] = df_employment["Employment"].apply(
    lambda x: sort_employment.index(x)
)
df_employment = df_employment.sort_values("Sort").drop("Sort", axis=1)

df_employment.plot.bar(
    x="Employment",
    y="Count",
    color="skyblue",
    edgecolor="black",
    legend=False,
    figsize=(4, 4),
)

plt.xlabel("")
plt.ylabel("")
plt.title("Employment distribution")

plt.show()
plt.close()
```

The income distribution is expectedly skewed to the left. The employment
distribution shows that the majority of respondents are employed
full-time.

```{python load-dictionaries}
# | echo: false

# load features dictionary
features = pd.read_csv(f"data/features.csv")

# load answers dictionary
answers = pd.read_csv("data/answers.csv")
```

While customer responses might vary based on demographic data, Kano
analysis does not consider the demographic characteristics of the
respondents.

### Aggregating Responses

Next, we will aggregate the responses to functional and dysfunctional
questions for each feature. The table below shows an example of
aggregated answers for a feature with ID = F1.

```{python check-answers}
# | echo: false
# | warning: false

# check if all variants of answers are present in dictionary

df1 = df[["F1_functional"]].dropna().drop_duplicates()
df1.columns = ["Answer"]

# df1.merge(answers, how="left", indicator=True).groupby("_merge").size()
```

```{python create-long-df}
# | echo: false
import re


value_vars = [col for col in df.columns if re.findall(r"F\d+_", col)]
index_vars = [col for col in df.columns if col not in value_vars]

df_long = df.melt(
    id_vars=index_vars,
    value_vars=value_vars,
    var_name="Question",
    value_name="Answer",
)

df_long = df_long.dropna(subset=["Answer"])

# add code to answers
df_long = df_long.merge(answers[["Answer", "Code"]], how="left")

# extract type and id from question
df_long["Type"] = df_long["Question"].apply(lambda x: re.sub(r"F\d+_(.+)", "\\1", x))
df_long["Type"] = df_long["Type"].str.capitalize()

df_long["ID"] = df_long["Question"].apply(lambda x: re.sub(r"(F\d+_).+", "\\1", x))

# add columns for functional and dysfunctional codes
mask = df_long["Type"] == "Functional"
df_long.loc[mask, "FuncCode"] = df_long.loc[mask, "Code"]

mask = df_long["Type"] == "Dysfunctional"
df_long.loc[mask, "DysfCode"] = df_long.loc[mask, "Code"]
```

```{python groupby-agg}
# | echo: false

# group by columns and aggregate functional and dysfunctional codes
columns = ["ID", "Income_us", "Gender", "Age", "Employment", "Education"]

df_final = (
    df_long.fillna(0)
    .groupby(columns)
    .agg({"FuncCode": "sum", "DysfCode": "sum"})
    .reset_index()
)

# merge with features dictionary
df_final = df_final.merge(interp, on=["FuncCode", "DysfCode"], how="left")
```

```{python tbl-agg-answers}
# | echo: false
# | tbl-colwidths: [5, 20, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]
# | label: tbl-agg-answers
# | tbl-cap: Example of aggregated answers for a feature.

pd.options.display.float_format = "{:0.0f}%".format

d = dict(selector="th", props=[("text-align", "center")])

df_final.style.set_properties(
    **{"width": "10em", "text-align": "center"}
).set_table_styles([d])

df_final.query("ID == 'F1_'").groupby(
    ["ID", "Functional", "Dysfunctional"]
).size().unstack().fillna(0)
```

### Calculating Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction Scores

After aggregating the responses, we calculate the satisfaction and
dissatisfaction scores for each feature using @eq-satisfaction-influence
and @eq-dissatisfaction-influence. The table below shows the qualities:
Attractive (**A**), Indifferent (**I**), Must-be (**M**),
One-dimensional (**O**), Questionable (**Q**), Reverse (**R**), as well
as satisfaction (**S**) and dissatisfaction (**D**) scores for each
feature.

```{python calc-scores}
# | echo: false
# | label: tbl-scores
# | tbl-cap: Qualities and satisfaction and dissatisfaction scores for each feature.
# | tbl-align: center


df_agg = df_final.groupby(["ID", "Category"]).size().unstack().fillna(0)

# trim name to one letter
df_agg.columns = [col[0] for col in df_agg.columns]

df_agg["Total"] = df_agg.sum(axis=1)

df_agg = df_agg.apply(lambda x: x / x["Total"] * 100, axis=1)

df_agg["S"] = (
    (df_agg["A"] + df_agg["O"])
    / (df_agg["A"] + df_agg["O"] + df_agg["M"] + df_agg["I"])
    * 100
)
df_agg["D"] = (
    -(df_agg["O"] + df_agg["M"])
    / (df_agg["A"] + df_agg["O"] + df_agg["M"] + df_agg["I"])
    * 100
)

df_agg = df_agg.merge(features[["ID", "Question"]], on="ID")

df_agg = df_agg[["ID", "Question", "A", "I", "M", "O", "Q", "R", "S", "D"]]

df_agg["ID"] = df_agg["ID"].str.replace("_", "")

df_agg["Sort"] = df_agg["ID"].str.extract(r"(\d+)").astype(int)
df_agg = df_agg.sort_values("Sort").drop("Sort", axis=1).reset_index(drop=True)

df_agg.style.highlight_max(
    color="lightgreen",
    subset=df_agg.columns[2:-2],
    axis=1,
).format(
    lambda x: "{:0.0f}".format(x) if type(x) == float else x,
)
```

### Plotting the Kano Diagram

The last step is to plot the features on a Kano diagram. The quadrant in
which the feature is located indicates a Kano category. The further the
from the center, the higher the influence on satisfaction or
dissatisfaction.

```{python plot-diagram}
# | echo: false
# | fig-align: center
# | label: fig-kano-diagram
# | fig-cap: Kano diagram

# plot Kano diagram

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))

sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_agg,
    x="D",
    y="S",
    hue="ID",
    style="ID",
    s=200,
)

plt.ylim(0, 100)
plt.xlim(-100, 0)

plt.axhline(50, color="black", linestyle="--")
plt.axvline(-50, color="black", linestyle="--")

plt.xlabel("Dissatisfaction Influence (%)")
plt.ylabel("Satisfaction Influence (%)")

plt.text(-25, 95, "Attractive", fontsize=10, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-75, 95, "One-dimensional", fontsize=10, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-75, 5, "Must-be", fontsize=10, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-25, 5, "Indifferent", fontsize=10, ha="center", va="center")

plt.gca().invert_xaxis()

plt.legend(
    title="Feature ID", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 0.5), loc="center left", frameon=False
)

plt.show()
plt.close()
```

```{python create-image-png}
# | echo: false

# create preview image

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


df_agg["Label"] = df_agg["ID"].str.extract(r"(\d+)")

sns.set_style("ticks")

plt.figure(figsize=(3, 3))

sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_agg,
    x="D",
    y="S",
    hue="Label",
    style="Label",
    s=100,
)

plt.ylim(0, 100)
plt.xlim(-100, 0)

plt.axhline(50, color="black", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.75)
plt.axvline(-50, color="black", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.75)


plt.text(-25, 95, "Attractive", fontsize=9, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-75, 95, "One-dimens.", fontsize=9, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-75, 5, "Must-be", fontsize=9, ha="center", va="center")
plt.text(-25, 5, "Indifferent", fontsize=9, ha="center", va="center")

plt.xlabel("")
plt.ylabel("")

plt.gca().invert_xaxis()

plt.legend(
    title="Feature", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 0.5), loc="center left", frameon=False
)


plt.savefig("image.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
plt.close()
```

## Application of the Kano Model

The Kano model can be applied in product development to prioritize
features and functionalities based on customer needs and expectations.
By categorizing features into the five Kano categories, product managers
can identify which features are essential, which are nice to have, and
which can create a competitive advantage.

The Kano model can also help product managers understand customer
preferences and make informed decisions about resource allocation and
product development. By focusing on Must-be Quality and One-dimensional
Quality features, product managers can ensure that the product meets
basic customer requirements and maximizes customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, the Kano model is a valuable tool for prioritizing
features and functionalities in product development. By understanding
customer preferences and categorizing features into the five Kano
categories, product managers can create products that meet customer
needs and expectations, leading to higher customer satisfaction and
competitive advantage.
