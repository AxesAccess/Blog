This application is designed to create product cards for an online
store. It utilizes a large language model (LLM) and programming
libraries to generate detailed descriptions based on product
specifications, images, and files. This allows a business to streamline
the process of crafting informative and engaging product listings with
minimal manual effort. This enhances both productivity and content
quality.
