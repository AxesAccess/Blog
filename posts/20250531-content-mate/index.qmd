This application is designed to create product cards for an online
store. It utilizes a large language model (LLM) and programming libraries to
generate detailed descriptions based on product specifications, images,
and files. This allows a business to streamline the process of crafting
informative and engaging product listings with minimal manual effort.
This enhances both productivity and content quality.
