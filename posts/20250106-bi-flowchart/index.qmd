## Intro

In this post, I'd like to present a blueprint of a BI system that I've
been working on. The system is designed to provide insights into the
company's performance and help make data-driven decisions.

## Architecture

The BI system is built on top of Google Cloud Platform, which provides a
scalable and secure infrastructure for running data-intensive workloads.

The BI system consists of several modules that work together to deliver
insights to end-users. The flowchart below illustrates the main
components of the system and how they interact with each other.

## Modules

### ETL

The first step in the process is to collect data from various sources
such as databases, APIs, and files. The data is then stored in Google
BigQuery.

### Airflow

The ETL process is orchestrated by Apache Airflow, an open-source
platform that allows you to programmatically author, schedule, and
monitor workflows. Some of the tasks are triggered [by the arrival of
new data](../20241105-airflow-filesensor/), while others are scheduled
to run at regular intervals.

### DBT

While the data stored in BigQuery is already structured, it may need to
be transformed to make it more suitable for analysis. **dbt** is a tool
that allows you to define transformations, often as views in SQL and run
them in a reproducible manner.

### ML models

In addition to traditional BI analytics, the system also includes
machine learning models that are used to predict future outcomes based
on historical data. The predicted values are then stored in BigQuery and
used in the reporting process.

### Power BI

The final step in the process is to visualize the data using Power BI, a
business analytics tool that provides interactive visualizations and
business intelligence capabilities.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the BI system described in this post is designed to
provide insights into the company's performance and help make
data-driven decisions. By combining ETL, Airflow, dbt, and Power BI, we
can create a powerful analytics platform that can scale with the needs
of the business.
