I'm an entrepreneur and data enthusiast with a strong focus on using
analytics to drive smarter business decisions. After years of running
my own company, I transitioned into the data space to turn intuition
and experience into measurable insights.

## From Business to Data

As a business owner, I managed operations, strategy, and performance
using data long before I wrote my first line of Python. That hands-on
experience gave me a practical understanding of what metrics matter
and how to translate numbers into action. Today, I apply data science
tools to solve business problems at scale.

## What I Do

My work centers around solving business challenges with data. Current
focus areas include:

-   Automating reporting and KPIs using SQL, Python, and Power BI\
-   Forecasting finance using statistical and ML models\
-   Designing ETL pipelines with Docker and Airflow\
-   Making sense of real-world data to support business growth

## About This Blog

This blog is my portfolio and a space to explore ideas, document
projects, and share solutions. It’s built to demonstrate how I approach
analytics from a business-first perspective.

When I'm not working with data, you can find me behind the camera.
Photography is my creative outlet—it helps me slow down, observe the
world, and enjoy the process of framing and storytelling in
a different medium.
